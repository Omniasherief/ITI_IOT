## Use Cases

### 1. Connected Cars and Vehicle Telematics

- **Description:** IoT enables vehicles to communicate with each other (V2V), infrastructure (V2I), and the cloud. This connectivity supports telematics services like real-time navigation, traffic updates, and vehicle diagnostics.


**V2V** 

— exchanges data about a vehicle’s place, speed, and dynamics and also helps prevent collisions; 

**V2I** 

— exchanges data between a vehicle and road infrastructure (traffic lights, lane markings, and risk booths), and enables drivers to save their time by managing traffic and overflows or ranges; 

**V2P** 

— allows a pedestrian to connect with C-V2X via the mobile app, where they can check information about city transportation or taxis.



- **Value:** Enhances safety through collision avoidance systems, improves driving experiences with real-time updates, and reduces costs with predictive maintenance.

### 2. Autonomous Driving
- **Description:** IoT sensors, cameras, and LIDAR systems collect data to enable self-driving capabilities, allowing vehicles to navigate and make decisions autonomously.
- **Value:** Minimizes accidents due to human error, increases mobility options, and optimizes traffic flow.

### 3. Fleet Management
- **Description:** IoT devices monitor the location, speed, fuel consumption, and engine health of fleet vehicles, enabling remote management and optimization.
- **Value:** Enhances operational efficiency, reduces fuel costs, and ensures better compliance with regulations.

### 4. In-Vehicle Infotainment
- **Description:** IoT enables personalized and connected entertainment experiences within the vehicle, integrating music streaming, hands-free communication, and navigation systems.
- **Value:** Improves passenger experience and customer satisfaction while opening new revenue streams for automakers.

### 5. Smart Parking Solutions
- **Description:** IoT-enabled parking systems allow drivers to find available parking spaces in real-time, reserve spots, and make payments via mobile apps.
- **Value:** Reduces traffic congestion, saves time, and enhances urban mobility.

### 6. Remote Vehicle Control
- **Description:** IoT allows car owners to remotely control and monitor their vehicles through mobile apps, including functions like locking/unlocking doors and checking fuel levels.
- **Value:** Increases convenience, enhances vehicle security, and boosts user engagement.
